#PIC12F510_dev

A small and simple PCB design for developing circuits using the PIC12F510 and similar 8-Pin PIC processors.
The processor is 8-pin DIL and may be socketed, all other components are 0805 or SOT23 SMD.

Provides:
   3 high-current outputs, with on-board LED monitors
   2 protected inputs with capacitor debounce and pull-ups
   Power Supply Reversal protection
   In-circuit Programming Header
   Access to all PIC Pins

If you don't need all the output or input buffers, there is no need to populate the components
